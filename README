-Purpose behind this pull request.  I forked the page to look for performance opportunities.
I didn't have any ideas for improvement with this.  But when I looked at the page I realized
it wasn't responsive.  I thought I could implement this pretty easily without significantly
changing the style of the page.  Removing the https://yuilibrary.com/yui/docs/cssgrids/ 
dependancy might lighten the page.  Also, Yahoo has not supported the yui library since
2014 https://yahooeng.tumblr.com/post/96098168666/important-announcement-regarding-yui.

What I did:

-CSS Changes:
    [x] Removed the cssgrids file.
    [x] Removed all classes not found in pubstandards.css file from the HTML.
    [x] Used CSS Grid Columns and a tiny bit of flexbox to recreate the page layout and
    general style.
    [x] Tried to pretty closely recreate the original style with Vanilla CSS.
    [x] Added a little opacity to all the text on the screen to reduce the brightness of
    the white/yellow text on dark background.
[] Checked that the photo resolution couldn't be lowered without significantly reducing
quality using https://      .com 
[] Added media queries
    [x] First Breakpoint: ~1400 px Sidepanel looks a little snug.  ~1225px sidepanel img starts to touch center.
        -Looks good down to ~1050px.  Add spacing between each Substandards li element.
[] Second Breakpoint: ~800px, the word Substandards overlaps with main-content.  

[] Including Mobile-friendly layout.
[] Need to tidy and organize CSS file.
[] Test in Firefox
[] Test in Explorer.
-HTML Validation:
    [x] Trimmed trailing white space
    [x] Added appropriate meta tags to head
    [x] Changed 1st header from h2 to h1 to give html semantic meaning  per W3C Validation
    [x] Switched main content container from div to main tags for accessibility
    [x] Removed inline stylings for <iframe> & moved to CSS per W3C Validation.
[] Finish reviewing HTML for accessibility.
[] Add Tab-indexes?  (With sidebar structure first this could be helpful.  )
[] Review WCAG standards and apply in this case?
[] Turn WCAG standards (as you read it) into a checklist to skim through with all pages.
